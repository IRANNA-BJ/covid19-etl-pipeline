# ðŸš€ GitHub Push Commands - Run These Manually

## Step 1: Open Command Prompt (cmd) in your project folder
```
cd c:\Users\irann\OneDrive\Desktop\covid
```

## Step 2: Configure Git (First time only)
```
git config user.name "IRANNA-BJ"
git config user.email "irannajangannavar00@gmail.com"
```

## Step 3: Create Initial Commit
```
git commit -m "Initial commit: Production-ready COVID-19 ETL Pipeline"
```

## Step 4: Set up Remote Repository
```
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/IRANNA-BJ/covid19-etl-pipeline.git
```

## Step 5: Push to GitHub
```
git push -u origin main
```

## Alternative: All Commands in One Block
Copy and paste this entire block into Command Prompt:

```
git config user.name "IRANNA-BJ"
git config user.email "irannajangannavar00@gmail.com"
git commit -m "Initial commit: Production-ready COVID-19 ETL Pipeline"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/IRANNA-BJ/covid19-etl-pipeline.git
git push -u origin main
```

## What Each Command Does:
- `git config`: Sets your name and email for commits
- `git commit`: Creates a commit with all your files
- `git branch -M main`: Renames the default branch to 'main'
- `git remote add origin`: Links your local repo to GitHub
- `git push -u origin main`: Uploads your code to GitHub

## Expected Output:
After successful push, you should see:
```
Enumerating objects: XX, done.
Counting objects: 100% (XX/XX), done.
Delta compression using up to X threads.
Compressing objects: 100% (XX/XX), done.
Writing objects: 100% (XX/XX), XX.XX KiB | XX.XX MiB/s, done.

To https://github.com/IRANNA-BJ/covid19-etl-pipeline.git
 * [new branch]      main -> main
Branch 'main' set up to track remote branch 'main' from 'origin'.
```

## If You Get Errors:
1. **Authentication Error**: You may need to use a Personal Access Token instead of password
2. **Repository doesn't exist**: Make sure you created the repository on GitHub first
3. **Permission denied**: Check your GitHub username and repository name
